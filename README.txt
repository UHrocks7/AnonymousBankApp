This includes connecting code to local database on computer.

Chase M: Wrote "Static Analysis Tool" section of report. Wrote parts of code for Bank.java, connected code to local database
on computer, and ran static analysis tool on code. Wrote CSV files for testing database.

----Functions/Parts To Be Completed----
-User interface for program. This is to be done with a GUI. So far, program runs in a console (i.e. Terminal for Mac, Command
Prompt for Windows).
-Ability to access bank records (checking and savings accounts) to check balances

----Additional Notes----
In order to test out our program, Java and MySQL have to be installed on the user's computer. For developers/advanced users,
the Java Development Kit (JDK) can be installed to edit the code, as well as IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJIDEA.

time, like more than 5-6 weeks to complete this project, we might have a better program with enhanced functionality.
